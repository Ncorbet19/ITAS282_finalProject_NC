# ITAS282_finalProject_NC

  Do you want to start a movie club but don't know where to start? Start with my app MC
(working title). Start your movie club, invite friends, vote on what movie to watch, and set up a calendar for future movie nights. I will also use the LetterBoxd API (if I get early access) to show the movie poster, rating, description, and reviews of the movies if I dont use the letterboxed I will use the IMDB API

  This idea came to me because my friends and I would plan movie nights in our group
chat, but when you wanted to find out when the movie was, you would have to scroll thru thousands of messages to find it, so I wanted to make a movie night scheduling app to keep it in one very neat place.
