  Do you want to start a movie club but don't know where to start? Start with my app MC
(working title). Start your movie club, invite friends, vote on what movie to watch, and set up a calendar for future movie nights. I will also use the LetterBoxd API (if I get early access) to show the movie poster, rating, description, and reviews of the movies
